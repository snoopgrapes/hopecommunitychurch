    <h2>Key Insights</h2>

    <h3>👁️ Inward Spiritual Focus</h3>
    <p>
      Fixing your eyes on Jesus is an inward act—a discipline of the soul. It requires daily attention and intentionality to align your mind and heart with Christ.
    </p>

    <h3>✝️ Jesus: Pioneer & Perfecter of Faith</h3>
    <p>
      Jesus doesn’t just begin your faith—He sustains and completes it. His endurance on the cross is your model and motivation to persevere.
    </p>

    <h3>🌍 Set Minds on Things Above</h3>
    <p>
      Earthly distractions dilute spiritual vision. Colossians 3:2 reminds us to anchor our thoughts in heaven to stay focused on eternal truth.
    </p>

    <h3>🕊️ The Holy Spirit's Role</h3>
    <p>
      Like the blind man in Mark 8, our spiritual vision grows over time through the Spirit. He convicts, comforts, and reveals Christ progressively.
    </p>

    <h3>🚫 Self-Centeredness</h3>
    <p>
      Pride, performance, and even emotional over-fixation on self block grace. The sermon warns that spiritual burnout often follows inward obsession.
    </p>

    <h3>🚫 Self-Pity</h3>
    <p>
      Self-pity keeps you in a fog of hopelessness. It's a trap that warps your view of God, yourself, and others. The antidote? Refocus on Christ.
    </p>

    <h3>🙏 Prayer for Enlightenment</h3>
    <p>
      Spiritual sight is a divine gift. Ephesians-style prayers help believers gain clarity, strength, and joy in Christ-centered living.
    </p>

    <h2>Expanded Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Hebrews 12 paints the Christian life as a race. It demands endurance and focus—not on self, sin, or shame—but on the Savior. To "fix our eyes" is to live with holy vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spiritual sight is not instant. The blind man healed in stages reminds us that God’s grace often unfolds gradually. If your vision feels blurry, keep looking—Jesus is still working.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-centeredness and self-pity are not just emotional responses—they’re spiritual threats. They sabotage grace and obscure God’s perspective. Crucifying the self means laying down false narratives and picking up faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, seeing Jesus clearly means seeing yourself rightly—in grace, in love, and in truth. The clearer the view of Christ, the stronger the walk of faith.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This message is a call to spiritual clarity and intentional devotion. Fix your eyes on Jesus—He is the beginning and end of your faith. Through the Holy Spirit, through grace, and through surrender, your vision will be restored and your life transformed.
